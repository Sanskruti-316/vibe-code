# Vibe Code

Vibe Code is a personal/organisational collection of small coding projects, experiments, and utilities that showcase ideas, learning exercises, and useful snippets. This repository is organized into language- and feature-specific folders so you can explore, run, or reuse individual projects easily.

> If you're the repo owner and want different content or more specific setup instructions, tell me which languages, frameworks, or top-level folders to mention and I will update the README.

## Project overview

This repository aims to be a playground for building, learning, and sharing small apps and code experiments. Each top-level directory typically contains a standalone project with its own README, dependencies, and instructions.

Common contents you might find:

- Small web apps (React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS)
- CLI tools and scripts (Node.js, Python, Bash)
- Utilities and libraries
- Learning exercises and example implementations

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Sanskruti-316/vibe-code.git
   cd vibe-code

2. Inspect top-level folders and open the README inside the project you want to run. Many projects include their own setup instructions.

3. If a project has a package.json (Node.js):

   npm install
   npm run start

For Python projects, create a virtual environment and install requirements:

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running a project

Each subproject may have different commands. Common commands you may encounter:

- npm run start — start a development server
- npm run build — produce a production build
- python main.py or python -m module — run a Python script
- ./script.sh — run a shell script (make executable first: chmod +x script.sh)

If you’re unsure, open the project's folder and look for a README, package.json, pyproject.toml, or other manifest file.

## Testing

When present, run tests according to the project's language and tooling. Examples:

- JavaScript / Node: npm test
- Python: pytest

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
3. Make your changes and add tests where appropriate.
4. Commit your changes with a clear message and push to your fork.
5. Open a pull request describing the purpose of the changes.

If you intend to submit larger changes, open an issue first to discuss design and scope.
