Short description
A small web app for uploading, browsing, tagging, and viewing images. The project is structured so frontend and backend (optional) live inside `photo-gallery/`, while repo-level configuration and docs are at the root.

Get started
1. Open `photo-gallery/` to see project-level instructions.
2. Add screenshots to `photo-gallery/docs/` to make the README more inviting.
3. Follow the contributing guide in CONTRIBUTING.md if you want to help.

See `photo-gallery/README.md` for full setup and development instructions.
